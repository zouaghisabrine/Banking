# Bank account kata

The Bank Kata project is implemented to describe the basic functionality of a Banking Application

## User Stories

```bash
'US1'

In order to save money
As a bank client
I want to make a deposit in my account

'US 2':

In order to retrieve some or all of my savings
As a bank client
I want to make a withdrawal from my account

'US 3':

In order to check my operations
As a bank client
I want to see the history (operation, date, amount, balance) of my operations
```

## Requirements

```bash
Deposit and Withdrawal
Account statement (date, amount, balance)
Statement printing
The expected result is a service API, and its underlying implementation, that meets the expressed needs.
Nothing more, especially no UI, no persistence
```

## BDD

To create BDD scenario with cucumber so you should to add ***cucumber*** dependancy

  ```text
  
  	<!-- cucumber-dependency -->
  	
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
			<artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
			<version>5.0.0-RC1</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
			<artifactId>cucumber-junit</artifactId>
			<version>5.0.0-RC1</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
			<artifactId>cucumber-spring</artifactId>
			<version>5.0.0-RC1</version>
		</dependency>
		
		<!-- cucumber-dependency -->
		
  
  ```
